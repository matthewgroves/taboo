 * 				   "goods" might be dangerous (yield some chance of killing the agent) and yield utility
 * 					have some internal representation  of whether they enjoy the goods
 * 
 * Policies: 		have different modular components: 
 * 					"what" | Some good which is sanctioned 
 * 					"how"  | How likely it is for the system to punish (legal system efficiency)
 * 			  "punishment" | [0,1] punishment intensity 
 
 *			This is just a sketch, what else is relevant here?
 * 			Main goals: how do taboos emerge? Can they be removed overtime?
 * 						also, practice genetic/abm models.
